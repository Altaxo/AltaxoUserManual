# AltaxoUserManual

This repository contains the sources to build [Altaxo's](https://github.com/Altaxo/Altaxo) user manual.

Since the user manual is written using Altaxo, the subfolder `UserManual.axoprj` is representing an Altaxo project.
Usually, Altaxo projects are ordinary zip files (but with extension .axoprj) containing text, worksheet and graphs.
But Altaxo is also capable to open ordinary file system folders as a project, as long as they have the same content.
This is used here. The advantage in comparison to a zip file is, that git
version control can be applied to each file in this folder separately.

## Instructions for opening the manual in Altaxo
