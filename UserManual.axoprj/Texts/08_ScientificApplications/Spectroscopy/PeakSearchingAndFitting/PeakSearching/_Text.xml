  <SourceText>##### Peak searching

Currently, two methods for peak searching are implemented:

1) Peak searching by topology search
2) Peak searching by continuous wavelet transformation

Peak searching by topology is faster than peak searching by continuous wavelet transformation. But it has problems when peaks are overlapping, for instance a peak is located in the shoulder of another peak.
Essentially, you can use peak searching by topology for spectra with well separated peaks and a low noise level.
For all other cases, peak searching by continuous wavelet transformation is the better choice.
