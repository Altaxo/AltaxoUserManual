#### The addin system

##### The `AddIn` node (Level 1)  {#AddinSystem_Node_Level1_AddIn}

The AddIn node is the root node of the addin.

###### The `StringResources` node (Level 2, parent [AddIn](#AddinSystem_Node_Level1_AddIn))
The `StringResources` node contains an attribute only: `file`, which designates the location of a .resources file (relative to the location of the .addin file) which contains common string resources for the addin.

###### The `BitmapResources` node (Level 2, parent [AddIn](#AddinSystem_Node_Level1_AddIn))
The `BitmapResources` node contains an attribute only: `file`, which designates the location of a .resources file (relative to the location of the .addin file) which contains common bitmap resources for the addin.

###### The `Runtime` node (Level 2, parent [AddIn](#AddinSystem_Node_Level1_AddIn))  {#AddinSystem_Node_Level2_Runtime}

The runtime node contains one or more import nodes.


###### The `Import`node (Level 3, parent [Runtime](#AddinSystem_Node_Level2_Runtime))

The `Import` node has an attribute `assembly`.

The assembly attribute can have one of the following formats (see `Altaxo.AddinItems.Runtime.Load()`):

- an assembly name starting with `:` means that the assembly is searched in the GAC and in the directory where the startup assembly is located.
- an assembly name starting with `$` should have the following format: `$AddinName/AssemblyName`. The assembly is searched in the directory where the specified addin file is located (and in subdirectories of it).
- all other assembly names are treated as they are. The assembly is searched beginning in the path where the addin file is located.</SourceText>
