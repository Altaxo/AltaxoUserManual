  <SourceText>##### Arrhenius law (rate)

This Arrhenius law describes the temperature dependence of e.g. reaction rates, typical frequencies, e.g. quantities that increase with increasing temperature.  
The function is defined as:
$$
y(T) = y_0 \exp\left(\frac{-E_a}{k T})
$$
in which $y$ is the reaction rate (dependent variable), $T$ is the absolute (!) temperature (independent variable), and $k$ is a constant, usually the Boltzmann constant, but it depends on the options you choose for the fit (see below).

The parameters are: 
- $y_0$ is the reaction rate in the limit $T\rightarrow\infty$
- $E_a$ is the activation energy.

Please note that for large temperature intervals, the y-value can vary over some orders of magnitude. This will lead to a poor fit, because the data points with small values of the reaction rate then contribute too little to the fit. 

In order to get a good fit nevertheless, it is neccessary  that you logarithmize your data points before they get fitted, and choose the `DecadicLogarithm` dependent variable option on this fit.

*Options for the independent variable x*:
- Kelvin: x is $T$ in Kelvin
- AsInverseKelvin: x is $\frac{1}{T}$
- DegreeCelsius: x is in °C
- DegreeFahrenheit: x is in °F
  
  

*Options for the dependent variable y*:
- Original: the original value of $y$ (the rate)
- Inverse:  the inverse of the rate, i.e. $\frac{1}{y}$
- Negative: the negative rate $-y$
- DecadicLogarithm: $\log_{10}(y)$
- NegativeDecadicLogarithm: $-\log_{10}(y)$
- NaturalLogarithm: $\ln(y)$
- NegativeNaturalLogarithm: $-\ln(y)$

  
  
*Option for parameters*:
- ParameterEnergyRepresentation
  - Joule: $E_a$ is in Joule
  - JoulePerMole: $E_a$ is in Joule per mole
  - ElectronVolt: $E_a$ is in eV (electron volt)
  - kWh, calorie, calorie per mole and more..

^^^ Fig. 1: Typical plot of an Arrhenius diagram (reaction rate by the inverse temperature). Here the parameters are $y_0=10^{12} s^{-1}$ and $E_a=80$ kJ/mol. Please note that if you choose the x-axis to be $ 1/T $ instead of T and the y-axis to be logarithmic, as in this example, the curve becomes a straight line. You can even include the "right" temperatures in °C by adding a second axis at the bottom, with inverse tick spacing and the transformation $x'=-273.15+x$.</SourceText>
