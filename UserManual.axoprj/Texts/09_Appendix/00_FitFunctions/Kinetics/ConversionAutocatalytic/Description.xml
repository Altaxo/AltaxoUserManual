  <SourceText>##### Conversion of an autocatalytic reaction

This fit function represents the solution of the differential equation for the conversion of an autocatalytic reaction (e.g. epoxy curing), namely:

$$
\frac{dc}{dx} = (k_1 + k_2 c^m)(1-c)^n \\ \\ c(t \le t_0)=0
$$

in which 

- $c$ is a value in the range [0, 1], e.g. the chemical conversion,
- $x$ is the independent variable (for a reaction, $x$ represents the time),
- $k_1$ and $k_2$ are a rate parameter,
- $m$ and $n$ are exponents,
- $t_0$ is the point (time) of the start of the reaction, i.e. $c(t_0)=0$.

&gt; **Important**: In this fit function, the **dependent variable $y$ is not the conversion** $c(x)$, but a scaled value of the conversion $y(x)=A_0 c(x)$, in which $A_0$ is an additional parameter!

The values of $y$, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are assumed to be positive. The value of $y$ before the start of reaction ($x \le t_0$) is assumed to be 0.

Since there is no general analytical solution of this differential equation, the solution must be calculated using an ordinary differential equation solver. This could make fits to a large data set somewhat slow.

The domain of the function is $-\infty \leq x \leq \infty$. 

&gt; Tip #1:  
&gt; To fit conversion data that are in the range [0,1], set the parameter $A_0$ fixed to a value of 1.

&gt; Tip #2:  
&gt; To fit conversion data that are in percent, i.e. in a range of [0, 100], set the parameter $A_0$ fixed to a value of 100.

&gt; Note:  
&gt; This kinetic equation assumes that the conversion finally reaches 1 (100%). This assumption may be wrong if the glass temperature of the finally cured material exceeds the curing temperature.
